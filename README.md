# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.


## Refactor Code to fulfill the Acceptance Criteria

We should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long term sustainability and to impress the clients. In this code refactor project, the semantic structure of the HTML elements was followed to organize the given code. Also, comments were included before each element or section of the page to make the code or section more easily understandable.

Semantic HTML elements were used to ensure the webpage meets accessibility standards. In this project, the structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Alt attributes were made accessible for the image elements. Also, the heading attributes were made in sequantial order. And lastly, the title element was named a concise and descriptive title.
